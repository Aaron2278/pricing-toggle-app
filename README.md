# Flexible Pricing Web Application
### About
This React-based web application allows users to choose from different pricing plans. The application features a dynamic user interface where users can toggle between monthly and annual payment options, showcasing various plans with detailed benefits. The app provides immediate visual feedback on the selected plans and includes a route to a thank you page after making a choice.

### Technologies Used
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, managing the application state using hooks like useState.
* **React Router**: Used for handling routing in this single-page application, enabling navigation between the different views without reloading the page.
* **CSS**: Styling is applied using CSS, with responsive design elements like flexbox for layout management and CSS transitions for smooth visual effects.
